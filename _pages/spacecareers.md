That's fantastic! Working in the space sector is one of the best things I've done so far.

I get a lot of emails asking "how do I get a career in space?", "where can I do space work experience?", "what do I need to study to work in the space sector?" Unfortunately, I don't have time to answer everyone individually.

Luckily, my friends and I built and ran a website that will answer (nearly) all your questions... _[SpaceCareers.uk](www.SpaceCareers.uk)_. 

_[SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/)_ has a whole load of current jobs, events, and competitions, and a huge bank of 30 job profiles, 40 advice articles, and 75 interviews. There's probably more since I last checked.

Do you have any Devon and Cornwall-specific advice?
==

This is a bit more niche so I'm collating my own set of Devon and Cornwall-specific space careers advice here. Be warned: it's a work in progress. I'll add more when I find the time.

**What space companies are even in Devon and Cornwall?**

In the UK, we've got groups of space companies. They're grouped locally and called 'space clusters'. Cornwall has a space cluster, but Devon doesn't. 

The Cornwall Space Cluster has made a lovely [map](https://www.cornwallspacecluster.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CSC-map-0322.pdf) to provide just the answer. To find out which companies are in Devon, it's more of a challenge but you can try the [Space Capabilities Catalogue](https://sa.catapult.org.uk/space-capabilities-catalogue/).

**Where can I find out find myself a space job in Devon or Cornwall?**

For Cornwall, I'd recommend checking out the Cornwall Space Cluster's [careers website](https://www.cornwallspacecluster.co.uk/careers/). There's currently no Devon equivalent. Instead, _[SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/)_ is a good bet.

**Where can I do space work experience or an internship in Devon or Cornwall?**

* In Cornwall, [Spaceport Cornwall](https://spaceportcornwall.com/) tends to offer annual in-person work experience for school-aged students.
* [Mission to Mars at Tech Cornwall](https://techcornwall.co.uk/mission-to-mars/) for those interested in software and robotics.
* In Devon, [The Met Office](https://careers.metoffice.gov.uk/early-careers/work-experience) has a range of opportunities for school and university students.
* [SPIN](https://sa.catapult.org.uk/work-with-us/space-placements-industry-spin/) or Space Placements in INdustry (for university and college students) is a nation-wide programme that sometimes has opportunities in the counties.
* Springpod offers [virtual work experience](https://www.springpod.com/virtual-work-experience) for school-aged students and is a great option if you can't find an in-person opportunity. There's everything from spacecraft manufacture to using satellite data.

**Can I study on a space course in Devon or Cornwall?**

Absolutely! Next Steps South West have also produced a [map of space-related courses](https://nextstepssw.ac.uk/content/uploads/2022/10/NSSW-Space-Ed-Courses-Map.pdf) that you can study at college and university level right across the South West.

Alternatively you could look at the list of space-related degrees in the [Space Training Catalogue](https://training.spaceskills.org/degrees).

**What other things can I do?**

Cornwall has some fantastic - but hidden - space sites and activities. Here's a few I'd recommend:

* Watch [interviews](https://nextstepssw.ac.uk/resources/space-education/?utm_source=Space+Week) with people working in the Cornwall Space Cluster
* Keep an eye on [Spaceport Cornwall's website](https://spaceportcornwall.com/whats-on/) for upcoming launch activites
* Read up on the activities [Cornwall Space Cluster](https://www.cornwallspacecluster.co.uk/)

* Find out about the ancient [astronomical heritage of Cornwall](https://archaeoastronomycornwall.com/)
